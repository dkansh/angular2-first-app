In the current module, I serve as the sole point of contact for SG Mumbai as well as the other clients. My main aim is to deliver the code with the utmost quality within the time and following the coding principles which makes our product more reliable and the best market fit. With this motto, I’m used to giving a peer-to-peer review to my leads and make sure the written codes are as per our industry standards. I’m the only developer for this module and always ready for challenges, in the past I had participated in POC’s for refactoring the existing code to use of latest tech versions of Java 8 and Maven. There are no productions issues recorded due to the code delivered by me other than the data corruption issues. Also fixed the security and sonar issues in all the releases at the earliest.
Always bound to the scope and successfully implemented GitHub [SGINDIA] within the time frame and contributed in Swift Revamp, segregated the common code to make as a reusable code. Constantly delivered without any spillages making sure the functional testing if any fixed immediately with less than 5% effort.
